# Architectural Decisions

## Decision 1: Use of Microservices Architecture
- **Date:** 2025-06-15
- **Status:** Accepted

### Context
The project requires a scalable and flexible architecture to support future growth and integration with various services. The existing monolithic architecture poses challenges in terms of scalability and deployment.

### Decision
Adopt a microservices architecture to allow independent deployment and scaling of services. Each service will handle a specific business capability and communicate with others via RESTful APIs.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Improved scalability, easier maintenance, and faster deployment cycles.
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in managing inter-service communication and data consistency.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture:** Easier to develop initially but poses scalability challenges.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Offers scalability but may lead to higher costs and complexity in managing stateful services.
