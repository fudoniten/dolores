# Architectural Decisions

## Decision 1: Use of Microservices Architecture
- **Date:** 2025-06-15
- **Status:** Accepted

### Context
The project requires a scalable and flexible architecture to support future growth and integration with various services. The existing monolithic architecture poses challenges in terms of scalability and deployment.

### Decision
Adopt a microservices architecture to allow independent deployment and scaling of services. Each service will handle a specific business capability and communicate with others via RESTful APIs.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Improved scalability, easier maintenance, and faster deployment cycles.
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in managing inter-service communication and data consistency.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture:** Easier to develop initially but poses scalability challenges.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Offers scalability but may lead to higher costs and complexity in managing stateful services.

## Decision 2: Adoption of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Date:** 2025-06-16
- **Status:** Accepted

### Context
To improve the efficiency and reliability of the software development process, there is a need to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline. The current manual processes are error-prone and slow down the release cycle.

### Decision
Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This will enable faster and more reliable releases.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Reduced time to market, improved code quality, and faster feedback loops.
- **Negative:** Initial setup and maintenance require additional resources and expertise.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Manual Deployment:** Simple but prone to human error and delays.
- **Using GitHub Actions:** Offers integration with GitHub but lacks some advanced features needed for our specific use case.

## Decision 3: Selection of NoSQL Database for Scalability
- **Date:** 2025-06-17
- **Status:** Accepted

### Context
The application needs to handle a large volume of unstructured data with high read and write throughput. Traditional relational databases are not well-suited for this requirement due to their schema constraints and scalability limitations.

### Decision
Adopt a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB, to store unstructured data. MongoDB's document-oriented model and horizontal scaling capabilities make it a suitable choice for our needs.

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Enhanced scalability, flexibility in data modeling, and improved performance for read/write operations.
- **Negative:** Requires learning curve for developers unfamiliar with NoSQL paradigms and potential challenges in ensuring data consistency.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL):** Offers strong consistency but lacks flexibility and scalability for unstructured data.
- **Other NoSQL Databases (e.g., Cassandra):** Provides scalability but lacks the document-oriented model that suits our use case.
